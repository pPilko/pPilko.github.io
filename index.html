<h1>
How To Make A Website In HTML
</h1>

<p>Peter Pilko - Enriched English</p>

<h2>
Tools You Need
</h2>

<p>To type up your code you must have a text editor <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a>,
<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>, <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/" target="_blank">Nano</a>,
<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=text+editors+for+programming" target="_blank">etc</a>.
You can find these on your web browser. To view your code you must have a web browser,
I prefer Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. You also need a place you can <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=web+hosting" target="_blank">host your website</a>
(I will go into this later).</p>

<h2>
Essential Files
</h2>

<p>Some essential files you need are an HTML, CSS, and an assets folder. The HTML
file is where your website is created. The CSS file is where you make your webpage
look decent. The assets folder is where you keep pictures, backgrounds, pdfs, etc.</p>

<h2>
Putting your website together with HTML
</h2>

<h3>
beginning
</h3>

<p>To start you website you must do many things. The first thing you must do is
create an HTML file. The folder can be named anything you want but has to end
in <code>.html</code></p>.

<p>The next step you must take is to make your document HTML. To do this you must
type the expression <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The next part you must do before you start inserting your information is to
make an HTML tag <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3>
The Head
</h3>

<p>The head is the information the computers look at from the tags you put in. To
define the head you must put in the tags <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The tags in the head give the computers different types of information to look
at. These tags are called title, base, link, meta, script, and style. They all define
information for the computers</p>

<h3>
The Body
</h3>

<p>The Body is the information the people who view your website look at. This contains
tags that tell the computer how to present your information to the user. For example
the body contains headers, paragraphs, images, links, videos, and other types of info.</p>

<img src="assets/example2.jpg">

<p>The tag <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> means paragraph.</p>

<p>The tag <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> creates a heading, h1 is a heading but is usually
used for titles, h2 is a subheading for h1, h3 is a subheading for h2, etc. These
headings range from 1 to 6 in size.</p>

<p>The image and video tag are quite obvious what they do. These are harder to make
because you have to have the video or image in a folder connected to your website
and you can't mess up the link.</p>

<h2>
  Making your website look good with CSS
</h2>

<p>To make your website look different ways you must have a CSS file. To link a
CSS file to your HTML file you must type the expression <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="home.css" type="text/css"&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Lets say you want to change the background of the webpage, to do this in CSS
you must create some lines of code like the ones showed below.</p>

<img src="assets/example3.jpg">

<img src="assets/example4.jpg">

<p>You can also indent paragraphs and have other cosmetics, but I won't go into
that.</p>

<h2>
making your website public
</h2>

<p>To let other people view your webpage you have to host it. Hosting a website
is when you publish your website to the internet. I use <a href="https://GitHub.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
to host websites because it is free, but if you don't want to use GitHub you can
use someone else or host it your self.</p>

<h2>
thank you

something!</p>
