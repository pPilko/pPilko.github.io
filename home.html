How To Make A Website In HTML

<h2>
Tools You Need
</h2>

<p>To type up your code you must have a text editor <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a>,
<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>, <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/" target="_blank">Nano</a>,
<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=text+editors+for+programming" target="_blank">etc</a>.
You can find these on your web browser. To view your code you must have a web browser,
I prefer Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. You also need a place you can <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=web+hosting" target="_blank">host your website</a>
(I will go into this later).</p>

<h2>
Essential Files
</h2>

<p>Some essential files you need are an HTML, CSS, and an assets file. The HTML
file is where your website is created. The CSS file is where you make your webpage
look decent. The assets file is where you keep pictures, backgrounds, pdfs, etc.</p>

<h2>
Putting your website together with HTML
</h2>

<h3>
beginning
</h3>

<p>To start you website you must do many things. The first thing you must do is
create an HTML folder. The folder can be named anything you want but has to end
in <code>.html</code></p>

<p>The next step you must take is to make your document HTML. To do this you must
type the expression <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The next part you must do before you start inserting your information is to
make an HTML tag <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3>
The Head *do later*
</h3>

<p>The head is the information the computors look at.</p>

<h3>
The Body
</h3>

<p>The Body is the information the people who view your website look at. This contains
tags that tell the computor how to present your information to the user. For example
the body contains headers, paragraphs, images, links, videos, and other types of info.</p>

<img src="assets/example2.jpg">

<p>The tag <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> means paragragh.</p>
<p>The tag <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> creates a heading, h1 is a heading but is usualy
used for titles, h2 is a subheding for h1, h3 is a subheading for h2, etc. These
headings range from 1 to 6 in size.</p>
<p>The image and video tag are quite obvious what they do. These are harder to make
because you have to have the video or image in a folder connected to your website
and you can't mess up the link.</p>
